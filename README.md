The entire dataset and simulation has been built from scrath by me. 

I have picked a hospital network use case to generate a digital twin by simulated logs. The logs are created using a variety of tools and techniques, and they represent a realistic sample of the network traffic that would be generated in a real-world hospital environment. The logs can be used to troubleshoot network problems, to identify security threats, and to plan for future network growth. 

List of devices categories picked 
Medical, IT and IOT devices. 
each of these are put in seperate folders and they contain a very unqiue and detailed list of characters that include 
IP address|MAC|Port|Dev Name|Dev Type|Application List|os_name|os_type|os_version|Serial No. - IT devices 


3D assets folder contains the images in sub folder for each of the device categories. The used 3D pictures are large in size henceforth saved all of them in .usdz format, I have also added a operation room scene.

Logs folder : Log Format
The simulated logs are formatted as follows:
Source IP address **|** Destination IP address **|** Protocol **|** Source Port number **|** Destination Port Number **|** Timestamp 
- **Timestamp** is the time and date of the log entry.
- **Source IP address** is the IP address of the source device.
- **Destination IP address** is the IP address of the destination device.
- **Protocol** is the network protocol used.
- **Source** **Port number** is the port number of the source device.
- **Destination** **Port number** is the port number of the destination device.
